the Cyborg Cats' Java robot code for FRC Steamworks 2017

The classes under com.cyborgcats.reusable were designed to work year after year with little to no modification, so they would likely work for other FRC teams using similar hardware. Please just cite our work in a comment somewhere if you decide to use it. Thanks!
